**// quick update on the direction of the blog //**

i've got tons of ideas for things i should write about - mostly technology (because that's my favorite hobby), but also some ideas exploring videogames and soundtracks, and some thoughts on cool music i've been listening to!

the Fall 2025 semester began today (senior year yayy), so it's no longer endless summer break, but that's no matter because the semester makes me think and explore quite a bit, and perhaps this blog is a good outlet for the inevitable procrastination demon...

expect to see *something* by the end of this week!! :fingerscrossed:

PS: i also learned i can set a post with the flag `published: false` within the markdown file, which lets me push half written posts as drafts, and resume them at will. it's all about flexibility and writing freedom on this blog!!
