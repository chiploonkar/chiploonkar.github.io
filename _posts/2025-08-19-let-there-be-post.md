```py
print("Hello world!")
```

and thus marks the founding of my blog! im not sure what i'll put on here, but it could be cool!

I'm using something called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which allows me to type stuff up in markdown (i loooove markdown) and automatically format it into pretty HTML + CSS using [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)). not the puppy ruby, although she HAS to be mentioned, so here she is:

![ruby](/assets/posts/2025-08-19-let-there-be-post/ruby.webp)

god she's cute. anyway, i should probably push this commit to the repo (i'm also using github pages linked to my subdomain [blog.pranavchip.com](https://blog.pranavchip.com)) and head to bed.

the inspiration for this blog was 2000s culture (think sk8er boi and AIM and uh, old internet things), so this is really awesome to write!!
