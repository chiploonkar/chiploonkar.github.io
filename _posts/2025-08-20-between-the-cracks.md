and no, that is not a valid URL. it's just this post's title! today we explore the niche, bizarre, and yet simply very technical architecture of the [Tor Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)).

this is a pretty... involved topic to cover, and I may switch between informal tumblrism lowercase and "proper punctuation" quite a bit. academic writing draws the spirit of my highschool english teacher out of me :3

so let's break this down into key sections, and then work through it together:
1. **defining** the onion
2. **peeling** the onion
3. **value** of the onion
4. *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* of the onion
5. idk other onion stuff (this analogy is wearing thin)

## (i) What is Tor?
Tor = "The Onion Router". To steal from Wikipedia <3
> Tor is a free overlay network for enabling anonymous communication. It is built on free and open-source software run by over seven thousand volunteer-operated relays worldwide, as well as by millions of users who route their Internet traffic via random paths through these relays.

Now that's a pretty fire explanation but I shall use a diagram to illustrate. Hmm... The diagrams I wanted to use look like they were made before 2005. archaic. I may have to make my own!! behold...
